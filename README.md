# Multiprogramming Operating System Project

## Project Overview

### Objectives

- **General Concepts**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of Multiprogramming Operating Systems.
- **Assembly Programming**: Learn how to write assembly programs for execution on a multiprogramming operating system.

## Introduction

This project involves the design and implementation of a Multiprogramming Operating System (MOS) for a hypothetical computer configuration, easily simulated (Shaw and Weiderman, 1971). The goal is to consolidate and apply concepts and techniques discussed in relevant literature, dealing directly with challenges in input-output, interrupt handling, process synchronization, scheduling, main and auxiliary storage management, process and resource data structures, and systems organization.

## Project Assumptions

We assume that the project will be coded for a large central computer facility (the "host" system). The host system ensures users cannot tamper with the operating system or machine resources. However, it provides a comprehensive set of services, including filing services, debugging aids, and a proficient higher-level language.

## Implementation Strategy

The global strategy is to simulate the hypothetical computer on the host and write the MOS for this simulated machine. The MOS and simulator are anticipated to consist of approximately 1000 to 1200 program cards, with the majority of the code representing the MOS. The project timeline is designed for completion over about two months, suitable for students concurrently taking a normal academic load.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the project requirements and documentation in the `docs` folder.
3. Set up the development environment as per the instructions in `setup.md`.
4. Explore the source code in the `src` directory to understand the implementation.
